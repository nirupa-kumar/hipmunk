# Hipmunk Coding Challenge

This has been done in reference to the coding challenge posted at : [Lessenger problem](https://github.com/Hipmunk/hipproblems/tree/master/lessenger)
The application has been created using Node.js and Express. To run the  application:
```
$~\lessenger>npm install
$~\lessenger>npm start
```

## To test:
* Access the UI available at : [Lessenger UI](http://hipmunk.github.io/hipproblems/lessenger/)
* Enter your <name> and hit send
* You should now be able to see a message Hi <name>!
* Enter "Weather in la"
* Upon hitting send, it should give you the current weather in Los Angeles with a summary of the weather for the day.

### Possible further improvements
* Adding a logger
